Sections are not divided conviniently which obstructs the user experience. Colors shceme is not very vivid, the site mostly is black and white. Icons should be more popping so are more easlihy noticable. Opacity on book hovering is not looking good, because the used images are transparent.","3","yes, as expected from the appearance of the website","3","Clear enough for differentiation of books.","Not sure. I did not had much information present excpet titles of the books as descriptions","4","3","Site awareness when navigation. No much interaction with the user. Navigation bar is one of them.","Please apply as much of the feedback you have gathered from me and other peers. You are a pop folk fan and I understand the struggle. Feel you borther.","6","Definitely when the applied feedback is applied. I would very much like to use the website after the idea is realized. The idea is a strong yes (:ü¶≠ü¶≠ü¶≠:)"
