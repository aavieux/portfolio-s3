## 3.3 Agile methods

Understanding the Essence of Agile Methodology

When it comes to software development Agile methodology shines as an iterative approach that values collaboration, adaptability and customer feedback. While I possess a comprehension of principles and the various well known methods associated with it my personal approach incorporates a combination of tailored Agile concepts that align with my unique work style.

Agile promotes collaboration, frequent reassessment of project goals and iterative development cycles. These core principles seamlessly resonate with my belief, in adaptability and responsiveness. I fully acknowledge the importance of user feedback and continuous improvements allowing me to progressively enhance projects.
### 3.3
However I don't rigidly adhere to any method alone. Instead I have embraced a customized approach that integrates principles into my workflow. My focus lies in communication channels, constant feedback loops and incremental development. This chosen path empowers me to embrace the essence of Agile while adapting to the requirements and nuances of each project.

In essence my methodology reflects an understanding of principles while also incorporating flexibility, beyond prescribed frameworks. This adaptive mindset ensures that I remain responsive to project needs while fostering an environment to efficient development processes.

### 5.1 Design choice
- Front end: React JS 

- Back end: Java Spring Boot

- Database: MSSQL

### 5.2 UX design
In order to have a good User Experience (UX), the project has to have a user friendly User Interface (UI) and an intuitive and easy to way of navigating through the application. 
After an extensive research on different online library User Interfaces I developed my own, which fits the modern etiquette of the front-end side of projects and delivers an easy and understandable way of navigation.
