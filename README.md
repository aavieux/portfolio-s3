## LO1. Web Application
<br>
### UI prototyping

I have made a lot of UI prototyping, self-studying and researching for my individual project. I researched the most famous online libraries and their UI structure and watched a few explanations on why their UI is user-friendly and effective. For the group project we had already chosen UI from the product owner. 
A prototype of my individual project you can see on page {...}

I also did some usability tests in school with my peers. I showed my prototype and overrall the feedback was positive including some remarks and suggestions from their side.

After a final discussion with the product owner I finally decided to implement my prototype.

### Testing in Agile Project {...}
I understood that you cannot go to deployment without testing. Ever. That ment that I had to research about different approaches for testing, their advantages and disadvantages. In the Netherlands Tmap HD is the most common agile method of testing. The phases used are:

    1. planning and management, this is where the Master test plan is written and the detailed test plans are started.
    2. preparation
    3. specification
    4. performance
    5. evaluation and completion 
    
### Software Development {...}


## LO2. Software quality 

The software quality side includes many factors such as:

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
    Choosing the right IDE for the technologies and languages you will use is crucial for a pleasant and easy work.

2. Version Control Systems:
    Version control (Git) systems helped track the changes in the source code in both my individual project and the group project, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of code modifications. 


3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools:
  See LO{....}

4. Code Review Tools:
   Code review tools facilitate peer code reviews, allowing developers to collaboratively review code changes, provide feedback, and ensure adherence to coding standards. For this purpouse I used github.

6. Performance Testing Tools:
  These tools simulate real-world user loads to assess how the application performs under various conditions, identifying bottlenecks and optimizing code and infrastructure for better performance.
For the front-end side of the applications I used Google's development tool called "Lighthouse".

8. Security Scanning Tools:
  No application can be deployed without identifing vulnerabilities in the application code and configuration. These tools help developers address security issues and improve the overall security posture of the software. I used OWASP
TOP 10 vulnerabilities list to examine my code and to avoid the most common mistakes that happen securitywise in applications.

## LO3. Agile methods

Understanding the Essence of Agile Methodology

When it comes to software development Agile methodology shines as an iterative approach that values collaboration, adaptability and customer feedback. While I possess a comprehension of principles and the various well known methods associated with it my personal approach incorporates a combination of tailored Agile concepts that align with my unique work style.

Agile promotes collaboration, frequent reassessment of project goals and iterative development cycles. These core principles seamlessly resonate with my belief, in adaptability and responsiveness. I fully acknowledge the importance of user feedback and continuous improvements allowing me to progressively enhance projects.

However I don't rigidly adhere to any method alone. Instead I have embraced a customized approach that integrates principles into my workflow. My focus lies in communication channels, constant feedback loops and incremental development. This chosen path empowers me to embrace the essence of Agile while adapting to the requirements and nuances of each project.

In essence my methodology reflects an understanding of principles while also incorporating flexibility, beyond prescribed frameworks. This adaptive mindset ensures that I remain responsive to project needs while fostering an environment to efficient development processes.

## LO4. CI/CD
{...}

## LO5. Cultural differences and ethics

  The cultural difference is mostly outlined in the group project. I am working with people with different nationalities such as from Turkey and Brasil. 
  Having a difference in the time zones of 5 hours, sometimes made it harder for us to cooperate and schedule meetings. Also understanding one's culture might be hard for somebody who hasn't participated in intercultural meetings, but at the end of the day
  if we try to understand each other's viewpoints and opinions, most of the time we can find a common way to deal with the setbacks.
  There are many books, and materials published that try to explain and dive deep into the different cultures and their charecters. Such is the book "Culture and organisations" by Gert Jan Hofstede, which was reccomended to me by my teacher Samuil Angelov,    which I would like to get familiar with soon.

## LO6. Requirements and Design 

### 5.1 Design choice of my individual project
- Front end: React JS 

- Back end: Java Spring Boot

- Database: MSSQL

### 5.2 UX design
In order to have a good User Experience (UX), the project has to have a user friendly User Interface (UI) and an intuitive and easy to way of navigating through the application. 
After an extensive research (mentioned in {...}) I developed my own, which fits the modern etiquette of the front-end side of projects and delivers an easy and understandable way of navigation.
